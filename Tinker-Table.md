The tinker table allows for custom enhancements to be put onto special items (see Titanium tools/weapon/armor and guns). To use the tinker table, place the modifiable item in the middle and place 4 upgrades surrounding it (if you want less than 4 upgrades, you can fill in the remaining slots with Base Upgrades).
