![Reactor Observers](https://i.imgur.com/qCat7Tu.png?1)

An optional part of the Fission Reactor multiblock. Reactor Observers output a comparator signal based on specific stats of the nearest reactor within 8 blocks. Currently there are 2 observers: Temperature and Reaction rate (for more info on these stats, see the [Fission Reactor](https://github.com/ImCoolYeah105/Mechanization/wiki/Fission-Reactor) page).
