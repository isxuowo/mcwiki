# Ore Generation
***
**Refining:**

All custom ores can be refined by placing them and clicking on them with a flint and steel.

**Notes:**
* Ore generation is a somewhat taxing process, so when loading new chunks there may be some mild server lag.
* Ore generation starts at 0,0 and spreads out from there. Teleporting away or moving away very quickly can prevent ore generation from spreading out properly.
