Most devices can receive a Machine Upgrade, with the additional upgrade of either Ender Upgrade or Nether Upgrade (only 1 can be chosen). Shift+Right click the upgrade on a machine to install. Ender/Nether upgrades require a Machine Upgrade to have been installed in the machine.

Machine Upgrades generally improve power and efficiency by a bit. Ender Upgrades generally greatly improve efficiency, while Nether Upgrades generally improve power but at a cost. However, the upgrades sometimes unlock entire new abilities.
