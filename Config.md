You can customize various datapack settings using an additional config datapack.

1. Download the [config datapack](https://github.com/ImCoolYeah105/Mechanization/releases) from the latest release.
2. Unzip it and put it in the datapacks folder with Mechanization and Datapack utils.
3. Navigate to `MechConfig/data/mech/functions` and open the config you wish to edit. Edit to your hearts content!

If new options are ever added to the config, you will need to re-download the config pack (or copy/paste the new settings).
