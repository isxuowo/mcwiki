The solar panel generates 2-6 kW based on the position of the sun. Additionally, you can right click on the solar panel to switch it to a lunar panel. The lunar panel will generate power at night, though at a reduced rate.

When Upgraded: Doubles power output.

The Bio Generator produces between 1-27 kW based on the variety of plant matter provided. Each type of plant matter has a different power output, and each unique type of plant matter adds its output to the overall output (see below table).

When Upgraded: Increases power output by 50%.

| Power Output | Plant Matter |
|--------------|--------------|
| 1 kW | Cactus, Melon Slices, Sugar Cane, Cocoa Beans & Beetroot |
| 2 kW | Potatoes, Carrots, Wheat, and Pumpkins |
| 3 kW | Melon Blocks, Nether Wart, & Chorus Fruit |
| 4 kW | Red & Brown Mushrooms |
| 5 kW | Chorus Flower |

## Ender Generator

Appears to be able to convert items from The End into raw energy at 32 kW, with rarer items producing power for longer. Hopefully the strange sounds coming from the generator isn't a fracture in space time or anything...

When Upgraded: Increases fuel efficiency by 50%.
