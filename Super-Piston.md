![Super Pistons](https://i.imgur.com/7PXgz48.png?1)

Super pistons are a special version of the normal piston that can move around tile entities and machines. However, they can only move up to 8 blocks, and cannot face up/down. There are currently 3 variants to the super piston: The normal Super Piston, the Sticky Super Piston (which can pull tile entities), and a Turn Table. The Turn Table will rotate machines on top of it.

These devices do not use power and cannot be upgraded.
