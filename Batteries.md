Batteries are the core of the energy grid system, serving not only as a way to store energy, but also as the energy transmitters. The energy system in Mechanization is completely wireless, with batteries serving as the relay between generators and machines. As such, a battery is required to get started in Mechanization. There are currently 3 tiers of batteries, with an extra Quantum Battery.

*The Quantum Battery is special in that, like an Ender Chest, it shares its contents across all other Quantum Batteries set to the same grid id. This works over any distance and across dimensions, meaning a Quantum Battery can be used to transfer power over any range.
