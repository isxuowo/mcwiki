The Machine Crafting Table is a custom crafting table used to make the machines and items in Mechanization. It differs slightly from a normal crafting table in that items remain inside when leaving the gui. Created at a Vanilla Crafting Table.

Note: any Smithed compatible crafting table can be used to craft items from Mechanization, including the default one.
