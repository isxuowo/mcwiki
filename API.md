Mechanization is modularized into a set of event calls and scoreboard information. As such, it is very easy to develop add-ons that use Mechanization's features to create a seamless experience. This page documents everything you might find useful in creating an add-on.

### Important References:

Mechanization depends on Datapack Utils for things like crafting, smelting, custom tools and world generation. Since Mech depends on DU, you can use all of its API in your project as well. You can get more information over on its [wiki](https://github.com/ImCoolYeah105/Datapack-Utilities/wiki).

Mechanization follows (as closely as possible) the conventions specified by the Minecraft Datapacks community, which helps to maintain compatibility between datapacks. You can reference them here: https://mc-datapacks.github.io/en/

# Energy API
***

Mechanization's primary feature is the energy grid. To create a device that interacts with the grid, set an entity's 'mech_power' score to 0. Then, give it one of these tags:
* mech_transmitter: Indicates that this device generates power, and should have power taken from it and put into batteries.
* mech_reciever: Indicates that this device uses power, and should take power from batteries.

Once a machine has one of those tags, it is automatically included in the grid. Further interaction is based on the mech_power scoreboard value. Generators should increase this value to reflect energy generation, and machines should decrease this value to reflect energy consumption.

To create a new battery that can send and receive power, summon an entity with the tag `mech_power_storage`. Then, run the following code segment both `as` and `at` an entity:
```
scoreboard players set in_0 mech_data <max transfer speed>
scoreboard players set in_1 mech_data <max machine buffer capacity>
scoreboard players set in_2 mech_data <max battery capacity>
scoreboard players set in_3 mech_data <Range: 12/16/24>
function mechanization:base/energy/battery
```

### Portable Energy

Mechanization supports drawing energy from compatible items in the player's hotbar. This is done using these lines of code:

    scoreboard players set in_0 mech_data 8 //This is how much power to draw
    function mechanization:base/tools/player_energy/use_energy

This will attempt to draw power from the player. It will then set the score 'out_0 mech_data' to 0 or 1, where 0 is failed to draw energy an 1 is succeed in drawing energy.

It is recommended to use built-in portable energy items (like Gadget's Portable Battery), but if you would like to make your own then give it the nbt tag 'Energy:1' (Energy must always be above 1). This item can then be charged at the Charging Station, or you can add your own way to charge it.

# Events
***
There are several event hooks built into mechanization. These are run using a function tag. To extend the event, in your datapack create the folder data/mechanization/tags/functions/[function] and add your functions in that tag (make sure to extend, not overwrite!).

### Tools
* wrench_break: triggers when player shift+right clicks a wrench, at the location they are looking. Should be used to safely break machines.
* wrench_function: triggers when player right clicks the wrench, at the location they are looking. Should be used to altar a machine setting, i.e. changing modes or rotating.
* multimeter_readout: triggers when player right clicks a multimeter, at the location they are looking. By default, prints out how much power the device is currently storing. Can be used to print out additional information.

### Machine Tags
* mech_no_upgrade: By default, any device can be upgraded. Adding this tag prevents that from happening.
* mech_upgraded: Tag added to a machine when a machine upgrade is applied. You should add in effects for each machine when upgraded (works faster, uses less energy, etc).
* mech_ender_upgrade: Tag added to a machine when an ender upgrade is applied. Machines require a machine upgrade to already be installed to add an ender upgrade (machine will have this tag AND mech_upgraded). This upgrade is exclusive to Nether Upgrades, so only 1 of the 2 can be added. Ender upgrades typically increase operating efficiency.
* mech_nether_upgrade: Tag added to a machine when an nether upgrade is applied. Machines require a machine upgrade to already be installed to add an nether upgrade (machine will have this tag AND mech_upgraded). This upgrade is exclusive to Ender Upgrade, so only 1 of the 2 can be added. Nether upgrades typically increase speed or power, but at a cost.

# Scoreboard Information
***
* mech_data: For math, temp variables and other misc data storage. Also used to store an extra bit of data on machines. Could be anything.
* mech_power: indicates power level on a machine/generator/battery.
* mech_gridid: used internally to specify machines' grid ids. You probably shouldn't mess with this.
* mech_usedid: has the Mechanization item ID of whatever the player is holding (if it has an ID), specified by the `mech_itemid:<id>` nbt tag. Very useful for checking what a player is holding instead of using an NBT check.
* mech_fluid: used to track how much fluid a machine is holding in its tank. Other objectives may be used if the machine has multiple tanks.

# Ore Dictonary
***
As of v3.0, Mechanization's ore dictonary system as been updated to follow the Minecraft Datapacks community guidelines on Ore Dict. You can reference them here: https://mc-datapacks.github.io/en/conventions/common_trait.html

The shorthand is Mech now uses the following format:
`Item.tag.ctc{id:"tin_ingot", from:"mechanization", traits:{ingot:1b, "metal/tin":1b}}`

# Tips
***
* While your free to create any content in an add on if you want, itâ€™s generally better to avoid overlapping content for performance reasons. Like, don't add another machine for processing ores unless it's unique.
* Need an API hook or think that something should be added to the API? Please post a suggestion in the issue tracker or on discord.
