The Fission Reactor uses uranium to boil water around it, which produces steam that can drive a turbine. To add fuel to the reactor, throw a uranium ingot on top of it (1 ingot at a time). A single ingot provides 60 secs of fuel.

**Warning: Reactors will explode if they overheat! This will create a large explosion- enough to destroy obsidian. Be careful about how you set up your reactors!**

### An Intro to Reactor Physics:
***
* Active reactors steadily heat up, increasing their heat level.
* Reactors boil nearby water into steam, the amount depending on it heat level.
* When water is boiled to steam, the reactor is cooled slightly.
* If the reactor attempts to boil water, but there is no water, then it heats up faster than normal.
* If a reactor become too hot, it explodes!
* The particles coming out of the reactor vents indicate heat level.
* An end rod my be placed immediately bellow the reactor to shut it off immediately, causing it to cool off slowly.
