**Note: the Chunk Loader is a legacy machine for the 1.14 versions, and currently does not exist in the latest version. May re-add at some point.**

The Chunk Loader is a powerful device that will keep a 3x3 area in the Overworld loaded at all times. Uses 256 kW.

When Upgraded: Allows the Chunk Loader to load chunks in the Nether and the End. Note: This will only load 1 chunk in other dimensions, and costs double the power. This is due to chunk loading other dims being very laggy.
