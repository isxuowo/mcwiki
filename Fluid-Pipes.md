Fluid Pipes transfer liquids between machines, such as pulling water from a Liquid Accumulator and transferring to a Steam Generator so it can produce power. Generally, if a machine can both input and output liquid (like how the Steam Generator can input water while outputting steam), then the top and bottom of a machine output stored fluid, and the sides input fluid. Input/output sides can be switched using the [Pipe Wrench](https://github.com/ICY105/Mechanization/wiki/Tools).
