The Lightning Generator is an extremely powerful generator that requires a lightning rod to be placed on top. When struck by lightning, the Lightning Generator briefly generates an infinite amount of power. However, the power goes away after 1 second, so you have a very short time to collect it with batteries/capacitors.
