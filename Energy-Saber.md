The Energy Saber is a powerful melee weapon that can be upgraded with Rods (ie. Iron Rod). Each rod has unique effects. Once upgraded, it gains the ability to be thrown with right click. While the Energy Saber is unbreakable, the Rods used to upgrade it have durability. The Energy Saber can be dyed any color.
