**Massive 2.0 Update is finally here, more than doubling the content!**

* Completely rewritten with the new 1.13 command features.

* Brand new resource pack with better models, textures, and sounds.

* Completely re-balanced progression and recipes.

 

Base Module:

* New Energy Grid ID system for protection your wireless energy network from potential thieves.

* Quantum Battery uses Grid ID for storage channels, rather than 10 preset channels.

* New Energy Relay: has a 48 block transfer range for getting power where you need it. Can also import/export energy from networks locked to a Grid ID.

* New Machine Upgrade: can be applied to any machine. Makes that machine more powerful by giving it extra functions, speeding it up, or makeing it use less power (effects vary between machines).

* New Multimeter: complement to the wrench, allows you to get information about machines like how much power is stored.

 

Age of Machines:

* Reworked Alloy Furnace to now accept stacked ingredients.

* New Growth Accelerator: speeds up the growth rate of crops when placed under farmland.

* New Auto Fisher: Automatically fishes fish and other goodies.

* New Lava Fabricator: Melts stone into lava.

* New Item Reformer: Repairs items at the cost of power.

* New Super Piston/Super Sticky Piston: Can move tile entities and machines. Cannot go up/down and can only move 8 blocks.

* New Turn Table: rotates blocks and machines placed above it.

* New Disenchanter: Removed enchants from items and puts them on books. Destroys the item in the process.

* New Spawner Controller: Decreases spawn time on spawners and makes them overall more consistent.

* New Spawner Mover: Can pick up spawners. 1 time use.

* Chunk loader is now more consistent and can work across dimensions (when upgraded).

* Teleporter now works across dimensions (when upgraded) and uses the new Grid ID system instead of item frames.

 

Nuclear Ascension:

* Reworked most of this module

* New Uranium Fuel Rod: Crafted from uranium ingots, is now the primary fuel.

* New Centrifuge: Refines nuclear fuels over time, Higher refinements grant more power, but are more unstable.

* New Reactor physics, see the wiki for more info

* New Control Rod: place bellow the reactor and apply a redstone signal to turn off the reactor.

* New Temperature/Reaction Rate Observers: Outputs comparator signal based on reactor's heat/reaction rate.

 

Gadgets:

* Reworked the upgraded system. Each item now gets 4 upgrade cards, which can be mixed and matched any way you like.

* New Titanium Weapons, Tools, and Armor: Upgradable erosion of diamond tools.

* New Portable Battery: supplies energy to upgrades/weapons while in hotbar. Stores up to 32000 kJ.

* New Charging Station: Charges the portable battery.

* Reworked gun physics. They don't lag out the game anymore.

* New Echo-Locators: Locate caves using sound.

* New XP Tank: Stores your extra XP.

 

New Module: Assembly

* New Autocrafting Devices:

    * Compressor: handles most 2x2/3x3 compression recipes.

    * Decompressor: The compressor, but in reverse.

    * Stone Cutter: Can create different variants of stone blocks.

    * Dye Machine: Can dye dye-able blocks.

* New Auto Jukebox: Apply a redstone signal to play music.

* New Fast Hopper and Ender Hopper
