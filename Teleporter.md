The Teleporter is a powerful device, capable and transporting a player over any distance (but not across dimensions) to another Teleporter set to the same frequency. The item frames on the sides act as a dialing mechanism. Rotate the items to set the frequency of the Teleporter, and then rotate the item frames on the destination Teleporter to link them. If more than 2 teleporters have the same frequency, than a random one is chosen.

Note: the destination Teleporter must be chunk loaded to work. Consider using the chunk loader where needed.
