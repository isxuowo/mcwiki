The Teleporter is a powerful device, capable and transporting a player over any distance (but not across dimensions) to another Teleporter set to the same frequency. The item frames on the sides act as a dialing mechanism. Rotate the items to set the frequency of the Teleporter, and then rotate the item frames on the destination Teleporter to link them.

Note: if more than 2 teleporters have the same frequency, than a random one is chosen.
