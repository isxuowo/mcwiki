The Mechanical Manual is an in-game guide to all items in Mechanization- like this wiki, but with added convenience! (It also tends to be slightly more up-to-date). You should get one for free when creating a world, but you can also craft one at either a vanilla crafting table or a machine crafting table.

The Mechanical Manual supports loading some extra manuals from 3rd party datapacks like The Creeper's Code, allowing you to keep all your information in a single item.

This recipe will work in the Vanilla crafting table and the Mechanical Crafting Table.

# Using the Manual
The first important page you will come across is the "Apps" page. The manual is split into multiple sections, and this page let's you switch section. When you select and app, the manual will close. When you reopen it, there will be new information.

### Page
Pages contain 3 things: a header, a description of the item, and a green arrow at the bottom. Clicking the green arrow takes you back to the table of contents. Hover your mouse over the header to see the item's recipe. Additionally, if you click the header the recipe will be displayed in the book's description so you don't have to re-open the book every time you want to see the recipe.
