A required part of the Fission Reactor multiblock. The Steam Turbine processes Steam produced by the Fission Reactor into power. Can process up to 50 kW- if the reactor outputs more than 50 kW * Number of Turbines, the extra power is wasted. Having more turbines than that does nothing (so if a reactor outputs 250 steam, and you have 4 turbines, 4 * 50 = 200, so you get 200 kJ and 50 kJ is wasted).
