Mechanization is a large and complex datapack adding a whole host of features. If you feel lost, here are some tips and tricks to getting started with Mechanization.

### Gather Resources
You will need a decent number of resource to get started. Getting about 16 tin and copper plus a stack iron and coal will be needed to get started, as well as some diamonds, gold, and redstone. Tin spawns above y=16, and copper above y=24, so remember to mine at higher elevations too! Besides ores you will need some sand, clay, and wool.

### Start Producing Power
To start making power, you will need to create a Furnace Generator and a Tier 1 battery. It's a good idea to have a constant supply of fuel for the Furnace Generator to use.

### Create Some Basic Machines
If you want to progress any further in Mechanization, you will need an Alloy Furnace. This device combines various ingots into better metals that can be used to create Tier 2 and 3 machines. Along with the Alloy Furnace, you can also make an Electric Furnace for slightly more efficient smelting. However, you may find it better to spend your resources on other machines.

### Upgrade Ore Production
The Grinder is an incredibly important machine that can double ore output. You should get this as soon as possible in order to gain more resources. At this stage, a quarry may also prove useful in order to mine ores more quickly.

## Tips
* Remember vanilla mechanics- sometimes vanilla may offer a better way of doing something. For example, a fortune 3 pickaxe would be a great early game investment to get more diamonds and coal (for power).
