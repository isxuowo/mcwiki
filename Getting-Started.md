Mechanization is a large and complex datapack adding a whole host of features. If you feel lost, here are some tips and tricks to getting started with Mechanization. This is just an overview- see an item's specific page if you want to know more about it.

### Gather Resources
You will need a decent number of resource to get started. Getting about 16 tin plus a stack iron, coal, and copper will be needed to get started, as well as some diamonds, gold, and redstone. Tin spawns between -16 and 32. Besides ores you will need some sand, clay, and wool.

### Craft Basic Tools & Start Producing Power
You will need to craft a Machine Crafting Table for use in all other recipes. You will also need a Machine Wrench to pickup machines. A Multimeter is also a good investment if you can afford it. To start making power, you will need to create a Steam Generator or a Thermoelectric Generator.

### Create Some Basic Machines
If you want to progress any further in Mechanization, you need to produce Tier 2 (and later, Tier 3) Alloys. This requires an Arc Furnace to melt resources into liquids, an Alloy Furnace to combine item and liquids into new molten alloys (like Molten Steel), and Casting Table to turn the molten metals produced in the Alloy Furnace back into Ingots. Liquid Pipes will be needed to transport liquids between the machines.

### Tip: Remember your vanilla mechanics!
* A fortune 3 pickaxe is still a great early game investment, especially since you can multiply iron, copper, and gold nows!
* Infinite bonemeal farms are still the primary workhorse for farming
* Sometimes vanilla may offer a better way of doing something. Don't assume Mech is always the best option.
