### Multimeter

The Multimeter is a great tool for checking up on your energy grid. Right clicking with the Multimeter on a device will print out various information in the chat. For most machines this is how much energy they are currently storing, but some machines also have additional information. Shift+Right Click with the Multimeter to toggle the redstone control state. Most machines can be turned off using redstone, but default to the "no redstone control state." Use the Multimeter to change the state to "Redstone Control On" or "Redstone Control On - Inverted."

### Pipe Wrench
The Pipe Wrench can toggle the fluid input/output state on the side of machines. Most machines input fluids from the sides, and output fluids to the top and bottom. Using the Pipe Wrench, you can make it input from the top, and output to the north (or any other state).

### Vial

The Vial can be used to store liquids, like a bucket. However, it can also store gasses like Steam, and can hold less than 1 bucket of fluid at a time (if a tank has 100 mL of molten iron, the Vial can pick it up). Useful for clearing out little bits of liquid stuck in machines. You can also drink the contents of the vial, however questionable that may be. Drinking liquid experience specifically converts it back into levels.
