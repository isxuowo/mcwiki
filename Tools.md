### Multimeter

The Multimeter is a great tool for checking up on your energy grid. Right clicking with the Multimeter on a device will print out various information in the chat. For most machines this is how much energy they are currently storing, but some machines also have additional information. Sneak + Right clicking on a machine will set that machine's grid id to your current grid id. You can change your grid id with this command: "/trigger mech_gridid set <value>". Machines set to a grid id will only interact with other machines on the same grid id. Useful for keeping thieves at bay, or setting up sub-networks.
