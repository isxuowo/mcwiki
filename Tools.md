### Multimeter

The Multimeter is a great tool for checking up on your energy grid. Right clicking with the Multimeter on a device will print out various information in the chat. For most machines this is how much energy they are currently storing, but some machines also have additional information. Sneak + Right clicking on a machine will set that machine's grid id to your current grid id. You can change your grid id with this command: "/trigger mech_gridid set <value>". Machines set to a grid id will only interact with other machines on the same grid id. Useful for keeping thieves at bay, or setting up sub-networks.

### Vial

The Vial can be used to store liquids, like a bucket. However, it can also store gasses like Steam, and can hold less than 1 bucket of liquid (if a tank has 100 mL of molten iron, the vial can pick it up). Useful for clearing out little bits of liquid stuck in machines. You can also drink the contents of the vial, though that can be dangerous...
