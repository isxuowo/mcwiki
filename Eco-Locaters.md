Echo-Locators help a spelunker find caves for mining. When right clicked on a wall, the echo-locator will emit a sonar signal. If there is a cave, then the signal will be returned. (You'll want to have your sound on for this tool). There are currently 2 variants: The iron echo-locator has a range of 16 blocks, and the diamond echo-locator has a range of 24 blocks.
